Course_Coursera_Reproducible_Research
=====================================
This repository is for all of my work for the Coursera course "Reproducible Research". There is a directory for each class assignment (Assignment1 and Assignment2). 

For the peer reviewed repository for assignment 1, see my repository, "RepData_PeerAssessment1".

For the published peer reviewed work for assignment 2, see 

In each assignment directory is a readme for that assignment.
